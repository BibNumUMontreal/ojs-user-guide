In Website Settings you can configure the appearance of and information on your reader-facing website, set up your site's languages and archiving settings, and install and enable plugins. See [Learning OJS 3: Website Settings](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-website) for detailed instructions.

## <a name="context"></a>Appearance
Here you can change the look and feel of your journal website. 

To change the overall design, select a different theme. Some themes allow you to configure colours, but usually if you want to change fonts, colours, or minor aspects of the design you will need to upload a custom style sheet.

Upload a logo image, homepage image, and journal favicon. 

Drag and drop items that you want to appear or not appear on your sidebar. 

## <a name="context"></a>Information
You can add information about your journal for specific user groups that will appear as links on your sidebar if the **Information Block** is enabled under **Sidebar Management**.

## <a name="context"></a>Archiving
If you have an agreement with a LOCKSS network to archive your journal content, you can enable it here to make your content available to the network. 

## <a name="context"></a>Languages
Languages that have been installed on your site by an Administrator can be enabled for the user interface (UI), forms, and submissions.
* If you check off **User interface** for a language, the front and back end interface will be available in that language
* If you check off **Forms**, you will be able to fill in any forms or fields in the back end dashboard with content in that language
* If you check off **Submissions**, users will be able to make a submission in that language and submit metadata in that language
* **Primary Locale** is the language that your site will appear in first to users. If you have other languages enabled for the **User Interface** the user can select another language with the language toggle.

## <a name="context"></a>Plugins
Plugins extend functionality of OJS and allow it to interact with external tools and services. Installed plugins can be enabled and configured or you can install additional plugins from the **Plugin Gallery**.

## <a name="context"></a>Announcements
Create announcements or announcement types to appear on your site's homepage or be emailed to all of your readers.

## <a name="context"></a>Navigation Menus
Edit the existing navigation menus on your website. You can add and remove items, and re-order them. You can also create custom menu items that link to pages on your site or to another website, or even add a new custom menu.
