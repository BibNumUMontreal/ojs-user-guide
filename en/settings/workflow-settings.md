Configure all aspects of the [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow), including file management, submission guidelines and requirements, peer review deadlines and guidelines, email notifications, and much more. See [Learning OJS 3 Workflow Settings](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-workflow) for detailed instructions.

## <a name="context"></a>Submission

Set submission requirements, provide author guidelines, configure your submission file types and more.

Decide which types of metadata, such as keywords and references, your journal will support.

You can also determine whether or not the author should be required to provide each type of metadata during submission, or whether this information should be added by editors.

Your publication files may consist of a number of components, including the main article text, research materials, data sets and more.

When authors and editors upload files to a submission, they will be asked to identify the component of this file. You are encouraged to add or edit components to suit the particular needs of your journal.

Delete those that aren't appropriate for your journal. This will reduce the options faced by authors struggling through their first submission.

Provide authors with a checklist of tasks they should complete before completing their submission. This is a good place to indicate requirements for referencing, font size, line spacing, document format and more.

Provde any additional guidelines that are not adequately covered in the submission checklist and provide a copyright statement to inform submitting authors of their rights.

## <a name="context"></a>Review

Set all of your review policies and procedures, including deadlines, notifications, reviewer guidelines and more.

Choose the review mode that should be used by default.

- A **Double-Blind** review will prevent the reviewer and the author from knowing each other's identities.
- A **Blind** review will prevent the author from knowing the reviewer's identity.
- An **Open** review will allow the reviewer and author to know each other's identities.

An editor will be able to choose another type when needed, but will usually use the default.

By default, a reviewer will be able to view submission files before deciding whether or not to review it. Check this box if you would like them to accept a review assignment before viewing the files.

Provide reviewers with criteria for judging a submission's suitability for publication in the journal, which may include instructions for preparing an effective and helpful review. Reviewers will have an opportunity to provide comments intended for the author and editor, as well as separate comments only for the editor.

Reviewers will be asked to confirm that they comply with the competing interests disclosure policy you specify below.

If you'd like to request specific information from reviewers, you can build forms here. An editor will be able to select a form when assigning a reviewer, and the reviewer will be asked to complete that form when they are submitting their review.

## <a name="context"></a>Publisher Library

The Publisher Library provides a file repository for storing and quickly sharing common files, such as writing guidelines, author contracts and release forms, and marketing materials.

Items that are stored in the Publisher Library can be quickly retrieved and added into a [Submission Library](editorial-workflow#submission-library) to be shared with authors or assistants.

## <a name="context"></a>Emails

OJS sends a number of emails during various stages of the [Editorial Workflow](editorial-workflow), as well as other actions such as registration and submission acknowledgement.

The settings in this section allow you to edit the signature attached to each email, as well as change the default messages sent for each type of email.

You can view more about one of the emails in the list by clicking the dropdown arrow on the right.

*If you want to restore an email template to it's default, use the __Reset__ button to restore the default message. This button is only available for email templates that have been modified.*
