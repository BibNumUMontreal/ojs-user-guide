During the Production stage, the editor assigns production assistants who will help prepare the final publication files.

Common publication formats include PDF and ePub, but you may also prepare a number of other formats, such as HTML files or an eLens reader, depending on what formats your administrator has enabled.

## <a name="orientation"></a>Orientation

The Production stage provides three panels to create files ready for publication.

### <a name="production-ready"></a>Production Ready Files

All files selected by the editor for production will appear here. These typically include files that have been prepared during the [Copyediting stage](copyediting.md). Production assistants will use these files to generate the final publication formats.

### <a name="production-discussions"></a>Production Discussions

Editors and production assistants can use this panel to initiate conversations, if there are any details that need to be clarified before the final publication files can be created.

### <a name="publication-formats"></a>Galleys

Editors and production assistants can create galleys and upload files for each format type (e.g., PDF, HTML, etc.). Learn more about [publication formats](production.md#understanding-publication-formats).

Once galleys have been created and files have been uploaded, you can begin the approval process to [publish the submission](production.md#publish).

### <a name="participants"></a>Participants

Editors can add production assistants or layout editors from this panel. [Learn more](../editorial-workflow.md#participants).

## <a name="understanding-galleys"></a>Understanding Galleys

Each galley represents one type of file (PDF, ePub), and may have multiple files attached to it, such as separate chapter files or supplementary data.

### Organizing Your Galleys

How you choose to organise your galleys is up to you. But that flexibility may be confusing as you're just getting used to the publishing platform. Here are a couple of simple examples.

A typical journal might have one galley format named PDF with a single `.pdf` file uploaded to it. It might have another galley format named HTML with separate `.html` files uploaded.

In this case, you'd create two galleys, PDF and HTML, and upload the files separately under each.

## <a name="publish"></a>Publishing the Submission

Once you are ready to publish the submission, you must schedule it to an issue.
